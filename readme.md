# Mosbot 

I had the idea to start this project as a way to unify the [psadmin.io mosbot](https://github.com/psadmin-io/mosbot-cli) codebase. There's of course the ruby version I linked and I believe the website and maybe the slackbot run as a python lambda function (?).

I thought about just using the ruby version and creating a function from that but I chose the hard way.
